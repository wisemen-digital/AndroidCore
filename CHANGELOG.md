### Breaking
- Deprecating the Measurement API in favor of a [standalone API](https://github.com/appwise-labs/Measurements)

### Improvements
- The generic function to get a service is limited to extensions of `BaseService`.
- Deprecated everything regarding Bagel, instead Proxyman is the next successor.
- Updated some dependencies!
- Improved the inner workings of Proxyman so multiple connections won't make the adapter crash.


## [1.4.3](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AndroidCore/releases/tag/1.4.3)

### New Features
- Added new functionality in the way of Validators, which can be used in Activities, Fragments and Compose. These can be used to validate certain forms of input fields, switches and many more.


## [1.4.2](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AndroidCore/releases/tag/1.4.2)

### New Features

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed thread bug for the coroutine exception

### Improvements
- Created a function to get a service in a more generic way for the networking client
- A status code can now be found when an Api Error occurs.


## [1.4.1](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AndroidCore/releases/tag/1.4.1)

### Improvements
- Removed the deprecation warnings of the `doCall` function as this must still be backwards compatible.


## [1.4.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AndroidCore/releases/tag/1.4.0)

### New Features
- Added DataRow (+ extras) to the project.
- Added a new way to do our Network calls. Errors can now be handled on a 'per call' basis instead of just a flat-out exception. The old way is still available for older projects.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue where the `allPermissionsGranted` was a false positive
- Fixed some crashes for ProxyMan so the app won't crash when it's run on an emulator or a ProxyMan client cannot be found anymore.

### Documentation
- Added required dependencies when importing Room or Core

### Custom Views
- Added DataRow (+ extras) to the project.

### Improvements
- Reworked the ViewModelExtensions a bit to add a general `viewModelFactory` function to the list. It accepts a ViewModel without any restrictions to the parameters. Also deprecated some functions.


## [1.3.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AndroidCore/releases/tag/1.3.0)

### New Features
- Created Measurement API to easily convert between units and also format the description with the correct Locale.

### Bug Fixes
- Added `getConverterFactories()` to the `BaseRestClient` so we can reorder ConverterFactories if needed.
- Changed the default exception handler in the `BaseViewModel` so it will use a LiveData callback instead of a high order function.
This makes sure that errors in a coroutine in the `init{}` block can be handled as well

### Improvements
- Changed the way we provide a function to create/show a default snackbar.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AndroidCore/releases/tag/1.2.0)

### Breaking
- The signature of the `configureToolbar()` methods has been changed.
- Updated the visibility of some functions of the `BaseRestClient`.
- Added `GetGson()` back to the `BaseRestClient` so it can easily be extended with a `newBuilder`.

### Bug Fixes
- Cleaned up resources, removed unneeded imports, ...
- Changed immutable interceptor list mutable so the list can be easily added to.
- Fixed issue with the `logout()` function as it was breaking on Android API 31
- Fixed the issue where the sourceCode could not be inspected whilst using the modules as a dependency

### Improvements
- Fixed some styling issues with the ProfileActionButton
- Fixed issue with the textColor overriding the textAppearance color of a ProfileActionButton
- Added paging3 module to the build, it will provide some standard ways to add a paging source and will easily hook in to your current implementation with a repository interface and much more.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AndroidCore/releases/tag/1.1.0)

### Custom Views
- Added classes that are used to create fast, easy and commonly used views/components.
- This update contains InitialsImageView, ProfileActionButton , ProfileDataRow , Numberstepper


### Breaking

- Moved Core to a proper module, now a better abstraction can be achieved by adding more submodules to Core. Even a sample app can be created within this project as well. Details of the procedure can be found [here](https://appwise.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~635004520/pages/415989761/Android+Core+Multiple+Submodules).
- Networking, Realm and Room have been moved to separate modules as well.

### Bug Fixes

- Removed 'JCenter' from the repositories list as that [service has been discontinued](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/).
- Removed 'easyValidation' dependency as it was a deprecated library that was only available on JCenter.

### Improvements
- Added the possibility to override the choose if you want the Proxyman classes to show it's logs.
- Limited the number of calls/packages Proxyman holds in memory when there is no client available.
- Removed unneeded line that deleted Proxyman clients that weren't connected to your app anymore.
- Added the possibility to override the BaseRestClient's `getHttpLoggingInterceptor()` to provide a project specific logging level.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/appwise-labs/AndroidCore/releases/tag/1.0.0)

### New Features

- Added Double and Tripple triggers for LiveData.
- `tryNavigate` functions have been added.
- Added `ProxymanInterceptor` and more, now we can debug our request/response data for calls in the Proxyman mac app.

### Breaking

- Removed Realm from AndroidCore and replaced it with Room.
- Updated `EasyImage` dependency which had breaking changes in some of our Extension functions.
- Updated a lot of dependencies where a couple of them had some breaking changes, not major but still (functions turned to parameters).
- Using `BaseBindingVMFragment`, `BaseVMFragment`, `BaseBindingVMActivity` or `BaseVMActivity` won't require you to add the ViewModel as a generic object

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with our `parseError` where we didn't want to use a new Retorfit instance.
- FadingEdge will now work when adding padding to the `RecyclerViewEmptyLoadingSupport`.
- `kotlin_version` added to `build.gradle` so our dependabot won't fail it's builds.
- BaseEntity now expects an `id` param as an `Any` type.
- Extension function `setupRecyclerView` is now more flexible.
- Changed expected type of `id` from `Int` to `Any`

### Improvements

- Added an `extraLogoutStep()` in `BaseNetworkingListeners` so it's easier to potentially keep some values in Hawk when logging out.
- Added possibility to provide a custom `idColumnInfo` when needed in the `BaseDao`, default value will still be `id`
- Added possibility to add multiple ApiServices to a RestClient (possibility to use different baseUrl as well)

### Internal
